# Integrated Design Project

The lab folder consists of three major parts for Arduino: 

1. Feedback and Control of Servo and DC Motors
2. Wireless Charging, Photovoltaic, and Noise in Circuit
3. Data Exchange and Collection

The project folder consists codes for the robotic security car.

The project aims to develop a robotic security car to support security guards in their daily duties. The car has sensors and cameras to navigate complex indoor environments and detect potential security threats with face detection algorithms. Additionally, the security car is equipped with a voice control system that provides real-time information and alerts to security personnel. This system aims to provide an efficient and cost-effective solution to satisfy the increasing demand for security services. Furthermore, the surveillance and autonomous security car system could increase the reliability of security cars and reduce human error.
